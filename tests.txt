./philo 11 300 100 100 - diference of 1/2 of the sum of tte + tts, philos will probably die.
./philo 199 190 60 60 - diference of (1/2 of the sum of tte + tts) + 10ms), philos shouldn't die.
./philo 3 800 200 200 - 2x the sum of tte + tts, philos shouldn't die.
./philo 3 700 200 100 - 2x the sum of tte + tts, philos shouldn't die.
